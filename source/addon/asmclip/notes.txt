First, I just mixed up my asm functions to one big file, so there may be some conflicts
with label names in the asm file. Dame applies to the clipped.c file.

Notes about the zoom system:
You just need to set zoomf and zoominv for the functions to be ready, or use another system.
Note that if you use another system, the coordinates should not be changed the same way also.
Anyway, the zoom system is made so that zoomf = 1024 would produce no zoom. In that case
zoominv is also 1024. To zoom in, set zoomf to something less than 1024. zoominv will then
be higher than 1024.

I hope you will include this in your sdk, so please feel free to contact me in case of problem.

Some notes about performance:
I can give you some numbers, that will give you an idea of the speed improvment regarding the
official free sdk.

So, when you blit 20000 32x32 sprites at 50,50 using:
Zoom -> 2378 ms
ZoomTrans -> 2543 ms
FastTrans -> 1604 ms !!!
GpTrans -> 2573 ms
GpBit -> 1159 ms -> that's why I didn't try to make a quicker one

Note that for zoomed blits, the zoom factor was 1024, so the actual drawed size is 32x32.
In this case, even when zooming on the sprites, it's quicker than the sdk's GpTransBlt.

And, when you blit 20000 16x16 sprites at 50,50 using:
Zoom -> 630 ms
ZoomTrans -> 680 ms
FastTrans -> 418 ms !!!!!!
GpTrans -> 856 ms (lol)
GpBit -> 554 ms (again)

As the functions are optimized for 16x16 chunks, the sdk is much slower here. FastTransBlit
beats the sdk's GpBitblt function, and 32% faster ^^
